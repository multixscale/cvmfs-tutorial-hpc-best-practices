heavy load on the server that is being used to pull in the contents, as it has to fetch all the contents (which may be a large amount of data) in one large bulk operation.</p> <p>In addition, the repository contents will have to be synchronized in some way, which involves rerunning this process regularly.</p> <p>Finally, this approach somewhat defeats the purpose of CernVM-FS, as you will be

<code>stat</code> system calls against it.</li> <li>An <code>ext3</code> or <code>ext4</code> file system   is preferred (rather than XFS).</li> <li>A standard Apache web server should be installed,

The optimized <code>frontier-squid</code> distribution is recommended. For more information, see the CernVM-FS configuration.</p> <p>Alternatively, separate Squid proxy server machines can be configured in a round-robin DNS configuration and each forward to the Apache server. Note however that if any of them are down the entire service will be considered down by CernVM-FS clients. The impact of this can be mitigated through front end hardware load balancer that quickly takes a system that is down out of service.</p> Recommendations on garbage collection (click to expand) <p>If any CernVM-FS repositories being replicated have garbage collection enabled, the Stratum 1 also needs to run garbage collection in order to prevent the disk space usage from growing rapidly.</p> <p>See the CernVM-FS documentation for more details.</p>"},{"location":"access/stratum1/#setup-procedure","title":"Setup procedure","text":"<p>To set up a Stratum 1 replica server and configure it to replicate a particular CernVM-FS repository, you should:</p> <ul> <li>Install the <code>cvmfs-server</code> package;</li> <li>Add the public key of the CernVM-FS repository you want to replicate to <code>/etc/cvmfs/keys/</code>;</li> <li>Create the repository replica;</li> <li>Run the initial synchronisation;</li> <li>Configure <code>cron</code> to perform periodic synchronisation;</li> </ul> <p>In the sections below, we will set up a Stratum 1 replica server for the EESSI CernVM-FS repository <code>software.eessi.io</code>.</p>"},{"location":"access/stratum1/#installing-cernvm-fs-server","title":"Installing CernVM-FS server","text":"<p>Start with installing the <code>cvmfs-server</code> package which provides the CernVM-FS server tools.</p> <p>Although we won't actually use the functionality that requires it, we also need to install a package that provides the <code>mod_wsgi</code> Apache adapter module.</p> For RHEL-based Linux distros (incl.

a more production-ready setup in place for using CernVM-FS.</p> <p>Using both a proxy server and a Stratum 1 replica server is another step in that direction, since it further improves the resilience, maintainability, scalability, and performance of the setup (since the proxy server can serve request from its memory cache).</p> <p>For the sake of demonstration we have used two separate systems for the Stratum 1 replica server and the proxy server, but both services can also be installed and configuration on the same server, and also installing multiple proxy servers is sensible to improve load
